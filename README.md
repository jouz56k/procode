Procode or Professionals coding is a web application 
supporting coding of occupations according to different classification schemes, such as ISCO, PCS, NSP (Swiss classification). The application
is developed using the Django API REST framework, while for its front-end side is used React.js with antd. 

Compared with the similar tools available online, Procode integrates a <strong>machine learning</strong> technique to support its users
coding the occupations. Over time, its training dataset will grow and improve the coding accuracy.
