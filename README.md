# Procode

Procode or Professionals/Occupationals coding is a web application 
to support the coding of occupations according to different classification schemes, such as ISCO. The application
is developed using the Django REST framework, while for its front-end side is used React.js with antd. 

Compared with the similar tools available online, Procode integrates a <strong>machine learning</strong> technique to support its users
coding the occupations. Over time, its training dataset will grow and improve the coding accuracy.
